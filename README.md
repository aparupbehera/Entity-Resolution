# Entity-Resolution

Enterprise data warehouses accumulate millions of identity records with inconsistent identifiers
— customer names with typos, suppliers with changing addresses, and individuals with evolving affiliations. Traditional fuzzy matching systems require constant manual tuning and fail
when encountering novel variations. This project presents a cloud-native ML system for entity resolution operating entirely within Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery and Vertex). The
system would handle temporal entity evolution through weekly incremental learning from user
corrections. Automated drift detection would trigger retraining when match quality degrades.
We would validate on financial crime detection, where resolved entity graphs expose fraud rings
invisible to rule-based systems. The approach could generalize to Customer 360, KYC, and
supplier consolidation too.
